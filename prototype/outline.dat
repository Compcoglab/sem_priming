the program will read in the data base
"spp_excel.csv"

then the program will read in the command file
"user_args.txt"

command file format
    - the first line of the file will contain arguments to be executed on the data,
      form of CSV List, where each string in CSV List is an operation that will narrow down results
      (make a list)
       
    - all lines after the first line will be target words to search the data base for (make a list)
    
the program will open an output file for writing results of searches to the file

search the user's list of target words first and make a reduced matrix of those words, output to file,
move to next step once word_list.empty()

then apply the narrowing criteria from queue inorder one at a time to smaller matrix,
make a reduced matrix of those words, output to file, etc...

keep going until ( list.empty() || reduced search matrix.size() == 0)

----------------------------------

vector< vector<string> > matrix;

matrix[i][j]

i = rows
j = columns

first row in matrix is column names

-----------------------------------

matrix[i][0] = target words

target words are sorted in alphabetical order,
could use a binary search to find entries in matrix

once word is located, extract row information
else print error message, search next word... etc

---------------------------------------


ALSO:
- might need space trimmer that takes leading && trailing whitespace off
